**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting thing we covered this quarter was integrating LLMs with predictive models. We have been training predictive models all quarter, and we are moving forward to the LLM component. We learned how to feel the probability outputs from the predictive models to LLMs to have them make decisions based on context and without bias.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

Our general idea for our quarter two project is just to make a model that accurately predicts whether an article is misinformation or not as well as a human could by just fact checking it themselves. We think this could have great applications in just overall internet browsing experience as well as making sure we contribute to an informed public.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

In Q1 we were pretty slow on the development process due to prior commitments. Going into Q2 our biggest thing is just to make sure we are all putting 120% towards this project to get the best end product that we possibly can!

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

Honestly I'm really interested in how we are going to implement agentic AI within our project. Our mentors have already kinda touched on this, but I'm so curious to learn more about the finer details.
